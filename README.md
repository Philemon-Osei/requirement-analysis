<h1>Requirement Analysis in Software Development</h1>
<p>This Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.</p>

  <h2>What is Requirement Analysis?</h2>
  <p>Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.</p>

  <h2>Why is Requirement Analysis Important?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><stong>Clarity and Understanding:</stong> It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.</li>
    <li><string>Scope Definition:</string> Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.</li>
    <li><strong>Basis for Design and Development:</strong> Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.</li>

    <li>Surveys/Questionnaires: Distributing surveys to collect requirements from a larger audience.</li>
    <li>Workshops: Organizing workshops with stakeholders to discuss and gather requirements.</li>
    <li>Observation: Observing end-users in their working environment to understand their needs.</li>
    <li>Document Analysis: Reviewing existing documentation and systems to understand current functionalities and requirements.</li>
</ul>
    </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Requirement Elicitation</h3>
  <ul> 
    <li>Brainstorming: Conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements.</li>
    <li>Focus Groups: Holding focus group discussions with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.</li>
    <li>Prototyping: Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and refine their requirements.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Requirement Documentation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Requirement Specification Document: Creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non-functional requirements.</li>
      <li>User Stories: Writing user stories to describe functionalities from the user’s perspective.</li>
      <li>User Stories: Writing user stories to describe functionalities from the user’s perspective.</li>
      <li>Use Cases: Creating use case diagrams to show interactions between users and the system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Requirement Analysis and Modeling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Requirement Prioritization: Prioritizing requirements based on their importance and impact on the project.</li>
      <li>Feasibility Analysis: Assessing the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.</li>
      <li>Modeling: Creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Requirement Validation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Review and Approval: Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.</li>
        <li>Acceptance Criteria: Defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.</li>
        <li>Traceability: Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.</li>
    </li>
